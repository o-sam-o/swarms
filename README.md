# Swarms

Overview
--------
Swarms is a movie/torrent discovery website.  The site uses the innately social nature BitTorrent to sort movies by popularity which makes it easy to discover new films or rips.  
The site tracks and records swarm sizes in order to provide history insight about the popularity of a movie.

Project Status
--------------
Creating a BitTorrent site is a fool's errand, their legality is questionable and the only practical income source is banner advertising.  That said I have always wanted to make a BitTorrent site,
I always felt there was something lacking, in the standard run of the mill boring table oriented torrent sites.  Somehow I started building Swarms in-between projects and I don't know here to stop.  
I don't really want to deal with the legal issues or the promotional activities required to build popular torrent site.  Therefore I have decided to have my own private installation of Swarms and put the
source up on github!
